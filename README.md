The benchmark campaign for the tensor4all [faer](https://github.com/tensor4all/faer)
fork: results keyed by **library commit × hardware profile**, measured at faer's
own API, with the staleness of every cell visible rather than implied. It is the
same shape as [`tlinalg-benchmark`](https://github.com/tensor4all/tlinalg-benchmark)
and [`tcontract-benchmark`](https://github.com/tensor4all/tcontract-benchmark),
which own the same job one layer up.

## Status

> **Provisional dataset:** this development host records provisional pages (`host.role: development`);
> a dedicated measurement host will re-record the suite periodically and replace them - see
> [`docs/provisional-and-clean-datasets.md`](docs/provisional-and-clean-datasets.md). Acceptance runs are
> separate, local and never published.

> **Provenance note (2026-10-16):** the runs recorded on 2026-10-15/16 linked the crates.io release
> `t4a-faer 0.24.5` for the fork row, not the pinned checkout — see
> [`docs/reviews/20261016-linked-crate-provenance.md`](docs/reviews/20261016-linked-crate-provenance.md).
> The build now refuses such a mismatch instead of warning.

`fbench` exists and records runs: the timing-v2 baseline is in
[`result/INDEX.md`](result/INDEX.md) (daily suite, both vendor arms), the harness
owns the workloads and the numerical checks, and the timing protocol lives in
`benchmarks/scripts/`. The frozen settings, the enforced machine preconditions and
the candidate-mode procedure for optimization iterations are in
[`docs/protocol-v2-baseline.md`](docs/protocol-v2-baseline.md); the per-run audit of
the baseline is in [`docs/reviews/`](docs/reviews/).

## From a page to its raw data

Every published number comes from one recorded run directory; nothing is copied by
hand, and the mapping is the same for every page.

| artifact | where | what it is |
|---|---|---|
| raw run | `data/results/<profile>/<suite>/<timestamp>-<label>/` | one recorded run |
| `run.yaml` | in that directory | identities (library, upstream, harness, toolkit), host and `host.power`, CPU sets, timing policy, guard policy, and the exact result/verification file names |
| `run<N>-<regime>-<T>t.csv` | in that directory | one CSV per complete process set: every row carries its chronological `samples_ms`, the observed thread budgets, status and note |
| `verify-<regime>-<T>t.csv` | in that directory | the verification census the timing was gated on, including declared skips |
| `*.guard` | in that directory | that process's idle-guard log, including discarded attempts |
| `build-info.json` / `binary-info.txt` | in that directory | build metadata (pins, rustc/cargo, features) and the vendor/thread identity the binary reported |
| `report.md` | in that directory | the run's local rendering of the same numbers |
| page | `result/<profile>/<suite>/<fork12>-<upstream12>[-<vendor>][-timing-v<N>].md` | the published numbers, generated from those CSVs |
| index | `result/INDEX.md` | generated: which pages exist, and whether a page is `current`, `partial` or `declaration-changed` |

`-timing-v2` marks a page recorded under the timing-v2 contract
([`docs/reliable-measurement.md`](docs/reliable-measurement.md)); historical v1
pages keep their original names and semantics. Spread is judged from the raw data:
within-process from each row's `samples_ms`, between process starts from the
`run0`/`run1`/`run2` files of the same cell, and admission history from the guard
logs.

## How it works

The harness lives **here**, not in the fork: faer has no `benchmarks/` directory
and the fork's `AGENTS.md` forbids adding one, because campaign infrastructure
would be a rebase cost. So `fbench` links the measured library *by path* from a
checkout, and it owns the timing protocol
(`benchmarks/scripts/{pinned.sh,idle_cpus.py}`) as well.

A result therefore depends on **three** independently moving revisions, and all
three are recorded in `run.yaml`:

| identity | what it is | pinned by |
|---|---|---|
| `library` | the measured fork checkout (`t4a-faer`, lib name `faer`) | `pins/t4a-faer.rev` |
| `upstream` | the upstream `faer` release the fork is based on | `pins/upstream-faer.rev` |
| `harness` | this repository, whose commit and dirty state can move a number | per run (`harness.commit`) |

```bash
# one vendor arm, build + verify + measure + validate + publish + reindex.
# One binary links one vendor library, so an arm is a run of its own.
python3 scripts/record_run.py zen5-cpu faer-kernels --vendor openblas \
    --checkout /path/to/t4a-faer --upstream /path/to/upstream-faer
python3 scripts/record_run.py zen5-cpu faer-kernels --vendor mkl \
    --checkout /path/to/t4a-faer --upstream /path/to/upstream-faer
```

Four arms are compared at faer's own API: the fork (`faer-fork`), upstream
(`faer-upstream`), CBLAS + LAPACK against OpenBLAS, and the same calls against
Intel oneAPI MKL. The two faer rows share one binary — the fork is package
`t4a-faer` and upstream is package `faer`, so they are distinct dependency keys
and distinct crate identities even though both declare `[lib] name = "faer"`. The
two vendor arms cannot share a process (they own the same symbols), so a vendor
arm is its own build, its own run and its own page.

## Tooling

The seven `scripts/*.py` entry points are thin shims over
[`campaign-toolkit`](https://github.com/tensor4all/campaign-toolkit), the shared
package the campaigns now have in common. `requirements.txt` pins it by git
revision; `benchmarks/campaign.yaml` is this campaign's descriptor, naming the
measured fork, the upstream baseline, the two vendor arms, the `order` case axis
and every other value the toolkit needs. The `schemas/` copies are gone: the
toolkit supplies them.

`scripts/setup_extern_deps.sh` materialises `extern/t4a-faer` and
`extern/upstream-faer` from the pins, which is what `gen_index.py --check` needs to
say whether a recorded page is current.

For local development, install the toolkit from a checkout instead of from git:

```bash
pip install -e ../campaign-toolkit
```

## What this repository is not

It is not the fork's per-PR gate; the fork's CI is a build, and this repository
owns the campaign. It is not tlinalg or tenferro marshalling, batch loops, lane
policy, tensor construction or dtype dispatch — those are `tlinalg-benchmark`'s
and `tenferro-benchmark`'s rows. It is not upstream's website bench page: no
nalgebra/eigen arms, no `fx128`. No API change to faer follows from it.
