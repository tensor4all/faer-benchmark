# Run one measurement pinned to CPUS, valid only if CPUS were idle right
# before and right after it. The command's stdout is printed only for a valid
# run; a run spoiled by other load is retried up to PINNED_RETRIES times
# (default 3), waiting PINNED_WAIT seconds (default 30) for the cores to become
# idle. Rejected executions are archived, never silently overwritten. A caller
# writing a CSV must declare its effective output path with PINNED_CSV; this
# generic wrapper does not guess a program's argument grammar.
#
#   pinned.sh CPUS -- COMMAND [ARGS...]
#
# Exits 75 when no valid run was obtained. CPU affinity is Linux-only: on
# other hosts the command runs unpinned and a note goes to stderr.
#
# This copy lives in the harness repository, not in the measured library: faer
# has no `benchmarks/` directory and the fork's AGENTS.md forbids adding one, so
# the harness owns the timing protocol as well as the binary. It is the copy from
# `tensor4all/tlinalg-rs` `benchmarks/scripts/pinned.sh` at c5d1d61f (see
# docs/provenance.md), itself adapted from `tensor4all/tprims-rs`
# (MIT, Copyright (c) 2026 Lukas Devos and tensor4all contributors). The
# effective idle window, busy threshold and retry budget are echoed to stderr,
# so the guard log of a run records the policy that was actually in force
# rather than the one the manifest assumes.
