# The measured library is the fork checkout named by `--checkout`; the baseline is
# the upstream checkout named by `--upstream`. Neither is fetched from a registry:
# the harness links both by path, so a run's manifest can name the two revisions
# it actually measured. `fbench` is built from *this* repository, because the
# harness is not part of the fork (the fork's `AGENTS.md` forbids keeping campaign
# infrastructure there, since it would be a rebase cost).
#
# Three things this deliberately does *not* do.
#
# It does not let baseline and candidate share a target directory, and it clears
# the compiler cache for the build: a cache keyed on inputs that do not include
# the sibling checkout can mix revisions. The target directory is keyed by the
# fork revision *and* the vendor arm, because the two arms are different feature
# sets and a shared directory would have the second build replace the first
# binary while the manifest still named the first.
#
# It does not let the environment decide the vendor's thread count. The build is
# asked for the vendor statically where it can be (`link-openblas-static` is the
# sibling's choice; this harness declares `link-openblas`), so the recorder can
# execute the binary directly instead of arranging a loader search path;
# `OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS` is dropped because `openblas-src` folds it into the built
# library, and the thread budget belongs to the measurement, not to the build.
# `OPENBLAS_DYNAMIC_ARCH` is *set* below, because that is the declaration of how
# the vendor was built.
#
# It does not guess which MKL either. `--vendor` names the arm -- one binary links
# one vendor library, so an arm is a separate build into a separate target
# directory -- and the MKL arm's `MKLROOT` and `MKL_THREADING_LIB` are resolved to
# *versioned* paths and reported back in `BUILD_ENV`. Nothing here follows
# `/opt/intel/oneapi/mkl/latest`: a moving symlink let a build record a version it
# never read back.
